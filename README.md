# React Dashboard Assignment

A responsive, client-side React dashboard application built using dummy APIs from JSONPlaceholder. This project showcases advanced data grid functionalities including sorting, searching, pagination, and persistence.


##  Features

-  **Profile Screen** – Fetches and displays the first user record from the users API.
-  **Comments Dashboard** – Loads 500 comment records and displays them in a sortable, searchable, paginated table.
-  **Search** – Partial text search by name, email, and comment body.
-  **Sorting** – Columns (`Post ID`, `Name`, `Email`) support 3-mode sort (none → asc → desc → none).
-  **Pagination** – Custom logic with page sizes (10, 50, 100) and numbered page buttons.
-  **Persistence** – All table states (search, sort, page size, page number) persist across reloads using `localStorage`.
-  **Responsive Design** – Works across desktops and mobile.
-  **Cross-browser compatible** – Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
